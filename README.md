This is my collection of scripts that I have/will/might create during my usage of Unity.
Feel free to edit and use.

WARNING: Some of these scripts might not be optimized

Planned additions/edits:
- Player Controller - WIP
- Vehicle Controller - WIP
- Inventory system (using either dictionary or sorteddictionary) - WIP
- Game saving/Inventory saving
- In-game graphical options menu
- Need to think of more ideas...
